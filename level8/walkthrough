the binary will check on stdin and compare it to commands like, auth, login, services, reset
"auth "
will malloc in the memory, and will prevent you to write  over 31
cause if the character at 32 is not "" it will log you when writing login
service in it side will  malloc in the memory and will write whatever you write
so if you manage to overwrite the 32 character after the "auth " command part
you'll get acces to the privilege access
